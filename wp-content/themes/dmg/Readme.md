A WP-CLI Command
Create a custom WP-CLI command named like, `dmg-read-more search`
This command will take optional date-range arguments like “date-before” and “date-after” If the dates are omitted, the
command will default to the last 30 days.
The command will execute a WP_Query search for Posts within the date range looking for posts containing the
aforementioned Gutenberg block. Performance is key, this WP-CLI command will be tested against a database that has
tens of millions records in the wp_posts table.
The command will log to STDOUT all Post IDs for the matching results.
If no posts are found, or any other errors encountered, output a log message.
